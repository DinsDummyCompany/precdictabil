I'll help you determine the best software stack for a bill tracking application that will be well-supported by AI coding assistance. Let me outline a modern, AI-friendly stack that would work well for this type of application.

For a bill tracking application, I recommend the following stack:

1. **Frontend**:
   - **React** with **TypeScript**: This combination provides excellent type safety and is very well-supported by AI coding assistants. React's component-based architecture makes it easy to build and maintain complex UIs.
   - **Next.js**: A React framework that provides excellent developer experience, server-side rendering, and API routes.
   - **Tailwind CSS**: For styling - it's highly maintainable and works great with AI assistance.

2. **Backend**:
   - **Python** with **FastAPI**: Python is one of the best-supported languages by AI coding assistants, and FastAPI provides modern, type-safe API development with excellent performance.
   - **PostgreSQL**: A robust relational database that works well for tracking bills, payments, and related data.

3. **Development Tools**:
   - **Git**: For version control
   - **Docker**: For containerization and consistent development environments
   - **VS Code**: The IDE that works best with AI coding assistants

4. **Key Features to Implement**:
   - Bill tracking and categorization
   - Payment scheduling and reminders
   - Analytics and spending insights
   - User authentication and data security
   - API integrations for bill providers

This stack is particularly well-suited for AI-assisted development because:
1. React and TypeScript have excellent type systems that AI can understand and work with
2. Python is one of the most well-supported languages by AI coding assistants
3. The tools and frameworks are modern, well-documented, and have large communities
4. The architecture is clean and modular, making it easier for AI to understand and modify

Would you like me to help you set up a basic project structure with this stack? I can create the initial files and configuration to get you started.
